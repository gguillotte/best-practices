# Summary

The pattern of managing Hieradata in a separate repository is both common and
acceptable. Doing so provides the ability to decouple the management of
configuration data from that of the Puppet code base. In general, separating the
configuration data from the Control Repository should only be done if a
compelling need is identified, for example:

* Delegating control or access to data
* Multiple Hieradata repositories are used to provide granular access
* Code development occurs at a different cadence than data changes
* Deployment process still dependant on promotion through static tiers

The `Puppetfile` is used to manage this separate repository when following this
best practice.


# Expectations

All new customers working with someone in CS should be directed to follow this
best practice if, and only if, there is an identified need for decoupling as
described above.

This best practice may also be applied to existing users if a need is
identified. However application of this best practice to an existing user may
not straight forward. The impact of adopting this best practice for an existing
user's workflow(s) should be explored and considered.


# Best Practice Details

## Users on Puppet Enterprise 2016.4 and later

The `Puppetfile` should contain a `mod` entry for the `hieradata` repository.
This entry will appear the same as a Puppet module entry, but will install the
contents of the `hieradata` repository into a separate path. The `:install_path`
option is available in PE version 2016.4 and above.

```ruby
mod 'default',
  :git          => 'git@git.example.com:site_data.git',
  :install_path => 'hieradata'
```

This will install into the environment into a `hieradata` path alongside the
`modules` path. The standard `hiera.yaml` will use this path for its `:datadir`.
You will need to update your `hierarchy` to reflect the name of the hieradata
repository.

This method will allow the use of multiple hieradata repositories, for cases in
which multiple teams must own separate pieces of the infrastructure. Note that
this is not recommended unless strictly required.

```yaml
---
:backends:
  - yaml
:hierarchy:
  - "default/nodes/%{::trusted.certname}"
  - default/common

:yaml:
# datadir is empty here, so hiera uses its defaults:
# - /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/%{environment}/hieradata on *nix
# - %CommonAppData%\PuppetLabs\code\environments\%{environment}\hieradata on Windows
# When specifying a datadir, make sure the directory exists.
  :datadir:
```

## Users on older versions of Puppet Enterprise

The `Puppetfile` should contain a `mod` entry for the `hieradata` repository.
This entry will resemble that of any Puppet module, and the `hieradata`
directory will be installed into the environment's default `modulepath` location
(`modules` directory).

This option should not be used in Puppet Enterprise 2016.4 or above.

```ruby
mod 'hieradata',
  :git => 'git@git.example.com:site_data.git',
```

Since this does not use the standard path for hieradata, you will need to update
your `hiera.yaml` to reflect this:


```yaml
---
:backends:
  - yaml
:hierarchy:
  - "nodes/%{::trusted.certname}"
  - common

:yaml:
# datadir is empty here, so hiera uses its defaults:
# - /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/%{environment}/hieradata on *nix
# - %CommonAppData%\PuppetLabs\code\environments\%{environment}\hieradata on Windows
# When specifying a datadir, make sure the directory exists.
  :datadir: /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/%{environment}/modules/hieradata
```

## Deployment Considerations

Choosing to manage your data in the manner described in this best practice will
require additional attention be paid to the process of deploying changes. Prior
to moving the Hieradata into it's own repository, when it was stored inside the
Control Repository, a change to data would invoke a deployment of the changes if
a WebHook trigger was configured on the Control Repository. Once the Hieradata
is stored separately, a change to the data will not trigger the configured
WebHook on the Control Repository. If auto deployment of Hieradata changes is
desired, the Hieradata repository (or repositories) may be configured with a
WebHook trigger as well.

If a WebHook trigger is configured on the Hieradata repository, it is important
to realize that this trigger will be invoking Code Manager to perform a
deployment of the Control Repository branch named after the Hieradata repository
branch that has changed. This trigger can "fail" to achieve the desired result
for a few reasons. First, if the branch name on the Hieradata repository that
triggered Code Manager does not match a branch name on the Control Repository
then a deploy will not be invoked.  Second, if version locking of the Hieradata
repository is` being done, the latest changes won't deploy until that value is
updated.


## Discouraged Options

### Gary Larizza Blog method In the past, managing hieradata as a separate
"source" in `r10k` has been recommended.  Many users are using instructions from
Gary Larizza's (now dated) Puppet Workflow blog to implement this method.

* http://garylarizza.com/blog/2014/03/07/puppet-workflow-part-3b/

This approach is now discouraged, and is considered more complicated and fragile
than required.  Adding an entry for `hieradata` into the `Puppetfile` is more
reliable, easier to implement, and allows the `Puppetfile` be the canonical
description of the environment.

### `moduledir` method In R10k 1.4.0, it became possible to use the `moduledir`
directive to direct R10k module entries to install modules in a non-standard
relative path. The `moduledir` directive can be placed before before all `mod`
entries in a `Puppetfile` to redirect the installation location. Though it is
not directly documented, the `moduledir` directive can be used to "reset" the
path `mod` entries install into at any point in a `Puppetfile`. In the past this
has been used to achieve a similar effect as the `install_path` argument on the
`mod` entry as detailed in this best practice.

```ruby
mod 'trlinkin/nsswitch'

moduledir 'hieradata'

mod 'site_data',
  :git => 'https://git.company.net/team/site_data.git'
```

This method is discouraged as it is an undocumented, unsupported use of
`moduledir`. This method is overall fragile and could no longer be available at
any time in the future without warning. When encountered, it should be replaced
with one of the acceptable methods detailed in this best practice.
